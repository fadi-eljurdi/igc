                            <p>Your Ultimate Guide for Proper Indie Game Marketing<br><br>Lots of game developers tend to invest a copious amount of time and effort into<br>conceptualizing all the way to developing high-quality games. The level of effort put into<br>a game can vary widely based on an array of factors such as the team’s expertise and<br>experience, the game’s scope and genre, which platforms it will feature, and the target<br>audience. It is known for a fact that game development is a fast-paced and highly<br>competent field that requires numerous complementary functions, that include, creating<br>a compelling storyline, coding, testing, promotion, among others.<br><br>Even though as we have just stated above that indie game development is a<br>multifaceted process that requires various tasks, we will be focusing on the marketing<br>side of things and how to market and showcase your end-product… In other simpler<br>words, “Indie Game Development Marketing 101!”<br><br>The Bread and Butter of Marketing<br><br>When thinking of marketing, what is the first thing that pops into your mind? You<br>guessed it, social media. Well, I am quite sorry to burst your bubble, but there are much<br>more important things that are essential. Don’t get me wrong! Social media is as equally<br>important as the other means of promotion, but in a complementary sense; which<br>means that social media marketing alone is not enough. What is the key to unlock this<br>riddle then I hear you ask? Keep on reading to find out.<br><br>App Store Optimization<br><br>We have all heard of search engine optimization (SEO), but never heard of app store<br>optimization (AOC).<br><br>When it comes to mobile game development, 50% of applications are discovered<br>through stores’ search function. The name of your game should be optimized according<br>to specific keywords that are relevant to your game’s genre. Additionally, a good copy<br>goes a long way to how you present your game and highlight why the consumer should<br>download it. Furthermore, the way you communicate your game’s message is also a<br>crucial factor to your success.<br><br>Message Boards<br><br>One effective marketing technique for indie game developers out there would be<br>posting your game on popular message boards such as Reddit, IGN, Steam Discussions,<br>etc.<br><br>Message boards are still popular in 2023 and a viable non-invasive option as they still<br>have many visitors and active members that start threads on various topics including<br>gaming trends and development. Moreover, you could get real feedback and get your<br>game critiqued which would contribute to a more successful and tailored experience.<br><br>Press Releases<br><br>Press releases are announcements sent to journalists or bloggers to inform them about<br>any breaking news or information about a particular subject; could be about your<br>business for instance or about your new game you just released.<br><br>Participate in Events<br><br>There are dozens of online and physical indie video game events all over the globe such<br>as AfricaComicade Gamathon, Game Devs of Color Expo 2023, Google Play’s Indie<br>Game Festival, and many others. What’s exciting is you could get to meet your target<br>audience in-person and use a direct sales strategy through selling or even giving away<br>physical copies of your game if it’s available for pc.<br><br>The Power of Influencers<br><br>We can’t deny the fact that people love to see what their favorite youtuber is up to and<br>are willing to try whatever he does. Gaming channels and influencers on youtube and<br>Twitch could be the perfect candidates for product endorsements and advertising. Such<br>a promotion could dramatically increase downloads and sales of a certain game due to<br>the simple fact that their favorite influencer is playing it.<br><br>Leveraging Content Marketing<br><br>Written content is an often overlooked step in a comprehensive marketing strategy for<br>indie games. Blogs, email newsletters, and other forms of written materials for instance<br>could help you in building awareness for your brand and a loyal fan base. Content<br>marketing takes consistency and patience, in addition to crafting content that would<br>appeal to your target audience. Incorporating teasers and screenshots of your newly<br>developed game for instance could trigger curiosity in your followers, which increases<br>the probability for visitors to take action on your website or landing page such as<br>subscribing, downloading, or purchasing.<br>Utilization of Social Media<br><br>Now comes everybody’s favorite part, social media marketing. No one can deny the fact<br>that social media is here to stay. Not only is it thriving and having its users increase<br>exponentially, but it has become one of the most important channels for modern day<br>advertising. How can it specifically help indie game developers? They could exploit<br>social media ads for a very thorough targeting strategy to reach an audience that would<br>be interested in your product, creating a mighty and efficient approach that would be<br>highly successful in getting potential clients to take action.<br><br>To recap, a properly developed game without effective marketing would not let your<br>game reach its full potential and get the appreciation it deserves. It might even render<br>your efforts futile. By following the above steps however, rest assured, that the time and<br>sweat you spent will not go in vain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>References:<br><br><br>What is an Indie Game &amp; How to Promote It Right.
