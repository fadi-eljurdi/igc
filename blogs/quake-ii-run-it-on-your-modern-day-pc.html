                            <h1>Quake II… Run It On Your Modern Day PC!</h1>
                            <p>Quake 2 was amazing 26 years ago, and it is still a lot of fun - even if its age shows quite a bit. The remaster is superb, with new content, crossplay, tons of options and meaningful upgrades under the hood. So if you want to experience a true classic in id Softwares history or simply have a taste for kick-ass retro action, this is the version to get”. One of many positive reviews on the Metacritic website.<br><br>We all remember back in the day waiting eagerly for Friday or Saturday to finally come; just sit down, relax, and fire up your pc and enjoy a good game of good old Quake II! This game was a blast when it was first released back in 1997 by id Software. Recent rumors however have circulated that Quake II will get a remaster of the original 1997 pc game. The leaks have been in fact true, as Quake II is now released for consoles, handhelds, & PCs.<br><br>For the youngsters out there that don’t know what Quake II is, it is a sequel to “Quake I” a popular fast paced first person shooter similar to “Overwatch”. It could be played through both single player and multiplayer player mode. The single player mode is basically a story mode of a Marine soldier called “Bitterman ”that’s given objectives that follow the flow of the game’s storyline. Bitterman is in charge of an operation called “Operation Alien Overlord” which is a preemptive attack on aliens before they<br>set foot on Earth to eventually invade it.<br><br>The multiplayer mode on the other hand could be played as a deathmatch or as a 1 vs 1 match through Local Area Network multiplayer (LAN). The nostalgia for this game got recently remedied as NightDive and id Software collaborated to<br>release a remastered version of Quake II with lots of improved models, textures, visuals, animations, and AI. Additionally, it features cloud saves, 4k resolution, 120 Hz refresh rate, and up to 4 split screens for multiplayer mode.<br><br>The games developers kept the original game missions "The Reckoning" and "Ground Zero", in addition to a newly added campaign developed by MachineGames called "Call of the Machine".<br><br>Quake II remaster also encompasses new features that havent been available in the original game such as a compass so that players could easily find their objectives, adding to the overall experience of the game. Even though this game has been remastered with upgraded visuals, it still holds in its folds a sense or feel of old first person shooters; particularly late 90s vibes. Making it a distinctive game even amongst flagship modern games with exquisite graphics.<br><br>The newly released game is quite easy on PCs and actually highly optimized and minimally demanding, thanks to the Quake II engine that it runs on. It requires a Windows 10 operating system, a third generation intel core i5 (preferably an i5-3570 3.4 GHz), a minimum of 8GB of system memory, at least 2 GB of hard drive storage, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 650 Ti or an AMD HD 7750 and a 1GB of VRAM.<br><br>Quake II is available today for PC (released on August 10, 2023) and other gaming consoles; Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Playstation 4, Playstation 5, and Nintendo Switch. The PC version could be downloaded on Steam, Epic Games and COG. Both physical and digital copies have been released at a price of $9.99.<br><br>Sources:<br><br><br>Wallace, A. (2023).
