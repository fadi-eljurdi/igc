                            <p>Steam to Convert Its Sales Currency to USD in Turkey, Argentina, &amp; Other<br>Countries<br><br>For this week’s blog post, we will be shedding light on Steam’s new pricing policy for both<br>MENA and LATAM regions.<br><br>No, we are not talking about water vapor! We are talking about Steam - a video game digital<br>distribution service that was developed by Valve.<br><br>In Turkey and Argentina, Steam has recently announced that the Steam store will change its<br>sales currency from the local currency to USD for all of its sales. This change will be effective<br>starting November 20th, 2023. Pricing will also be updated for both LATAM and MENA regions<br>which will also include Argentina and Turkey respectively. Steam has additionally<br>recommended reducing prices for the aforementioned regions and have updated their<br>suggestions in their pricing tools to reflect this. As a result, some countries might either see<br>pricing increase or decrease according to what games have been priced prior to the new<br>currency switch.<br><br>What Seems to Be the Issue?<br><br>The recent fluctuation in exchange rates in Argentina and Turkey has caused a significant<br>challenge for game developers in determining appropriate pricing strategies and maintaining<br>current prices. This issue has been a focal point of discussions during Steam&#39;s developer meet-<br>ups and roundtable sessions. Additionally, Steam has encountered difficulties in ensuring the<br>continuous operation of payment methods in these countries due to ongoing foreign exchange<br>fluctuations, fees, taxes, and logistical complications.<br>Which Exchange Rate will Be Used?<br>Steam will use the official US Bank exchange rate on November 20th to establish the<br>exchange rate, through which Steam users’ wallets will automatically convert to USD.<br><br>Will the New Regions Have the Same Game Prices As<br>the USA?<br><br>Game cre­ators usually set the price for their game­s on Steam for both the LATAM - USD and<br>MENA - USD areas. The deadline for providing new pricing for the LATAM &amp; MENA regions will<br>be Novembe­r 20th. If a developer fails to provide new USD prices by the aforementioned date,<br>Steam will switch to their de­fault USD cost.<br><br>Which Countries Will it Be Applicable To?<br><br>According to Steam, the Steam store will start using USD in the following regions/countries<br>below.<br><br><br>LATAM<br>Central America<br>Belize<br>El Salvador<br>Guatemala<br>Honduras<br>Nicaragua<br>Panama<br><br>South America<br>Argentina<br>Bolivia<br>Ecuador<br>Guyana<br>Paraguay<br>Suriname<br>Venezuela<br><br>MENA-USD Region<br>Middle East<br>Bahrain<br>Egypt<br>Iraq<br>Jordan<br>Lebanon<br>Oman<br>Palestine<br><br>North Africa<br>Algeria<br>Libya<br>Morocco<br>Tunisia<br>Sudan<br><br>References:<br><br>1.
