The Endless Legend Definitive Edition Bundle has a significant discount to offer fantasy gamers who enjoy the gameplay style.<br><br>Total War: WarHammer 3 | $24.99 (50% off)<br><br>For Total War: Warhammer 3, the past year has been quite unpredictable. The game's rating plummeted because of price increases and widespread dissatisfaction with infrequent patches. However, it remains an excellent game, particularly when combined with the greatest Total War: Warhammer 3 mods, which are becoming increasingly amazing.<br><br>Cyberpunk 2077 | $29.99 (50% off)<br><br>The most recent expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 isn't discounted separately. On the other hand, Phantom Liberty's free update brought about significant improvements for the base game, which is now 50% off. In addition, the bundle that includes Phantom Liberty and the main game is 39% off.<br><br>Resident Evil 4 | $39.59 (34% off)<br><br>Remaking such a classic was a risk for Capcom, as it could have ruined the franchise if the remake failed. But even though it falls short of the original, it's still a fantastic homage to the classic. There were few ways the result could have been better, but it could have been much worse.<br><br>Marvel's Midnight Suns | $19.79 (67% off)<br><br>The creator of XCOM, Firaxis, created a unique superhero game that combines friendship simulation, deck building, and gridded turn-based tactics. It is currently the most popular game released recently. Though it is undervalued, it is highly advised to purchase it while it is on sale, particularly now that the price is even lower than it was during the Summer Sale.<br><br>Hunt: Showdown | $13.99 (65% off)<br><br>Hunt has never found a lower price, and this one matches its winter sale offer. As of right now, it's still the most engaging first-person shooter available. Its approach should serve as a lesson to other extraction shooters and shooters in general.<br><br>Halo: The Master Chief Collection | $9.99 (75% off)<br><br>The big box of Halo is back at its lowest price for this sale. The Master Chief Collection includes every Halo up to Halo 4, including Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, and Halo 2: Anniversary.<br><br>Metro 2033 Redux | $1.99 (90% off)<br><br>This is one of the best single-player shooters out there on many different levels. The Redux version, which debuted in 2014, made use of 4A's most recent engine technology. The original debuted in 2010. At only $2, this is an incredibly impressive FPS.<br><br><br>Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen | $4.79 (84% off)<br><br>This is a huge sale on a fantastic fantasy role-playing game that came out on the PC in 2016. Play with your NPC friends in epic battles against massive bosses at the biggest Steam discount ever. There's also wonderful news regarding a sequel that's in the works<br><br>Lords of the Fallen | $23.09 (34% off)<br><br>Soulslike games have had a lot of success this year, and Lords of the Fallen is one of the best of them, adding depth to an already expansive genre. Soulslike fans should not miss this game because it features amazing mechanics that let them travel between different worlds and a wide variety of weapons to help them find their way around Axiom.
