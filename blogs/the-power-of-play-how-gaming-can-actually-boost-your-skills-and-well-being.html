                            <h1>The Power of Play: How Gaming Can Actually Boost Your Skills and Well-being!</h1>
                            <p>Gaming & Beneficial!!? Yes, these Two Words Mix!<br><br>“Can you turn off your computer? You have been gaming for the past 8 hours! That’s not healthy, you will strain your eyes.” A typical comment by a concerned mother about her son’s unhealthy habit of prolonged gaming.<br><br>Everything in moderation is key to a balanced and healthy lifestyle disregarding what you’re engaged with.<br><br>When it comes to gaming however, it has had a bad stigma ever since the very first existence of a video gaming console/device. But why does video gaming have such a bad perception amongst parents? Is it really that bad? Enjoy reading this article and let us get our facts straight!<br><br><br>Cognitive Benefits<br><br>Various research and studies have been conducted on this very topic, and concluded that gaming in fact possesses an array of cognitive benefits that could improve overall brain function such as improved memory, reaction time, mental flexibility, decrease in stress levels, among others.<br><br>"The researchers found that the children who reported playing video games for three or more hours per day were faster and more accurate on both cognitive tasks than those who never played. They also observed that the differences in cognitive function observed between the two groups was accompanied by differences in brain activity."<br><br><br>Enhanced Memory<br><br>It turns out that playing video games is not a mere pastime activity, but could in fact have a positive effect on our memory. On this very subject, two separate studies were conducted that comprised college-aged students and old adults in their seventies and eighties. The studys’ end-goal was to check the effect of playing a video game for a period of time on the human memory. It was concluded that playing video games positively influenced the hypothalamus, but what is more interesting would be that playing 3D games as opposed to 2D games had more favorable outcomes on strengthening the memory.<br><br>Additionally, playing video games has the ability to mitigate the mental decline that accompanies the natural process of aging and loss of brain cells.<br><br>In fact, various studies have shown that video gaming can stimulate neurogenesis, or growth of new neurons that are responsible for spatial orientation, memory formation and strategic planning. In addition to fine motor skills.<br>Enhanced Executive Functioning<br><br>Executive functioning could be defined as a person's ability to use his mental resources such as perception, attention, and memory to utilize in decision making and problem solving.<br><br>Video games for instance could improve one’s multi-tasking ability in high-workload environments.<br><br><br>Enhanced Job Related Skills<br><br>Numerous research points out that individuals who engage with video gaming tend to have an edge over their peers in their profession, skills wise.<br><br>A study was performed to assess a potential link between using video game surgery simulation and its effect on laparoscopic skill and suturing performance by surgeons. The study concluded that training curricula that integrate video games may help surgeons better adapt in handling technology and equipment used in laparoscopic surgery.<br><br>Video game skill correlates with laparoscopic surgical skills. Training curricula that include video games may help thin the technical interface between surgeons and screen-mediated applications, such as laparoscopic surgery. Video games may be a practical teaching tool to help train surgeons.<br><br><br>Enhanced Social Skills<br><br>Believe it or not, playing video games could actually better improve one’s social and communication skills. Playing games that require multiplayer collaboration for instance allows players to talk and make friends online. Throughout their virtual interaction with other players, video gamers could have a chance to practice responding to different types of possible situations that could be faced in real life.<br><br><br>Stress Relief<br><br>It is no secret that playing video games provides great stress-relief. Not only do they offer a soothing and relaxing effect, but they are a great harmless pass-time activity. They offer a space for an individual to unleash his creativity in a genre of gaming that appeals to him/her.<br><br>Another way for video games to relieve stress would be their ability to increase “dopamine”, also known as the “happiness hormone”. This non-invasive stress relief mechanism could ease one’s depression and brighten his day.<br>In conclusion, whether you are a parent who has been limiting your child’s computer play or firmly believe that it’s harmful, the above data could provide useful information on gaming’s beneficial effects. However, note that in excess, nothing can be beneficial. In fact, anything done excessively could prove harmful.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>References:<br><br>National Institutes of Health. (2022, October 24).
