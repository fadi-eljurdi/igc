                            <p>Cloud Gaming… Is it Time to Say Goodbye to Regular Gaming?<br><br>You have always wanted to play the latest and greatest games and triple-A releases. You head to Steam to download your favorite game. It’s finally done downloading! Now let the fun part begin! But there’s a problem, the game you just downloaded would not even run. How is this even possible? The answer is that your device is simply not powerful enough to run demanding games. But what could possibly be the solution I hear you ask? Well, you could either buy a new highly priced, cutting-edge gaming PC and run whatever game you throw at it, or you could opt into a more viable option that would be subscribing to a cloud gaming service.but modern and cutting-edge specifications would cost a hefty premium.<br><br>What is Cloud Gaming?<br><br>Cloud gaming or gaming on demand could be defined as a streaming service that provides high quality content. It is basically a method of playing video games through remote servers in data centers. Downloading and installing games on your PC is not even needed. This service only requires a fast and reliable internet connection to send gaming information to an application or browser that’s installed on the recipient’s device. The game is rendered and played on the remote server, but you are in control of everything through your device. Such service providers tend to charge by the hour, or even by the minute to gain access to their remote hardware. Several cloud gaming services have emerged in the past decade - the most popular being Nvidia’s Geforce Now.<br><br><br>Why is Cloud Gaming Important?<br><br>Cloud gaming could offer many advantages over regular gaming.
