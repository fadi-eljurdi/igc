                            <h1>But Why? </h1>
                            <p>Shocking twists and events unveil throughout the journey of finding clues about “Marissa Marcel”, a starlet whose disappearance has never been solved. How did she suddenly vanish? What’s the deal?<br><br>No, that’s not a series nor a movie scene, but it is available on Netflix. “Immortality” is a game among 70 other games that could be downloaded by Netflix subscribers for both Android, IOS, and the Netflix app.<br><br>We all know it and have used it. Netflix is basically a subscription-based streaming service that provides access to a vast library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and other forms of exclusive entertainment content. Having been founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in the United States, Netflix has revolutionized the way people consume and interact with entertainment through an innovative idea that is offering on-demand streaming of content over the internet, rendering physical DVDs or cable/satellite TV subscriptions obsolete. <br><br>Netflix announced recently that it will offer its subscribers video games without any extra cost. Its decision to penetrate into the gaming market has shocked the entertainment industry, signaling an audacious move in its business model. Additionally, this step is to offer diversification and expand beyond its core competency of streaming video.<br>The reasoning behind this market entry conceals an array of reasons.<br><br>Retention & Attraction of New Subscribers<br><br>Netflix’s services are not a monopoly anymore as many other streaming service providers have entered the market. In an attempt to stand out and attract new subscribers, Netflix introduced mobile games that allowed subscribers to play a fairly diverse selection without any additional cost as part of their subscriptions. This step is for captivating a new segment of audience which gaming appeals to.<br><br>Audience Engagement<br><br>Our past blog posts have tackled the phenomenon of ever-growing popularity of gaming and the gaming industry as a whole, so it is no secret that it is always a trending hot topic. Through the integration of gaming content into its platform, Netflix can keep its users amused and engaged for longer periods of time, which in-turn increases user loyalty.<br><br>Aiming for A Comprehensive Platform<br><br>Each and every platform nowadays is striving for making its brand recognizable by the most number of people through diversification of products/services. This growth marketing strategy’s end-goal is enhancing brand recognition, reach, and awareness. Moreover, it is a dynamic strategy that directly addresses the ever-changing needs and wants of consumers, which was the reasoning behind Netflix’s entry.<br><br>Global Reach<br><br>Gaming & gamers are everywhere in the world. Entering the gaming industry makes it feasible for Netflix to reach wider audience segments of certain regions where competition for video streaming content may be fierce or where such services are not in demand or poorly engaged with. <br><br>Revenue Stream Diversification<br><br>Different sources of revenue streams is the main reason why Netflix chose to enter the gaming industry. First off, it opens up several revenue stream sources that include increasing subscription fees due to the added service. Another reason would be in-game purchases like skins or mods for certain games. In addition to ad-supported gaming for mobile games, licensing and merchandising deals for popular game franchises, and esports involvement. Over and above that, Netflix could gather insightful and crucial data off gaming analytics for targeted marketing and research. <br><br>Partnerships & Acquisitions<br><br>Netflix can utilize its financial resources to form partnerships with established game developers, acquire gaming studios, or fund the development of original games. Additionally, acquiring or partnering with established studios can also bring in experienced and knowledgeable individuals of the gaming industry, which facilitates its market penetration strategy. <br><br>In fact, Netflix’s gaming arm has launched player gamertags and started hiring to develop a “AAA PC game” while bringing on big names like former Halo lead Joseph Staten. Ubisoft has even announced several games in development for Netflix, including an Assassin’s Creed title to go with a new live-action series the two companies are working on.<br><br>In short, even though it’s a bold step on Netflix’s side, games on their app have been having quite a decent number of downloads signaling an optimistic outcome. Add to that their collaboration with individuals and developers of large gaming companies. Finally, this venture could open the doors for other key players of various industries to follow Netflix’s path.<br><br><br><br>References:<br><br>Tiwari, S. (2023, March 28).
