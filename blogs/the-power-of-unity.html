                            <h1>The Power of Unity</h1>
                            <p>Why are Game Developers Running Away from Unity?<br><br>“My game will be a smashing success”… You have just got done testing and debugging your new game and you are quite excited for this new genre and concept you have just developed, but you remember one thing, Unity will be taking part of your revenue as part of its new pricing policy.<br><br>That really is a bummer right? The reason is that Unity engine has been long considered a haven for indie game developers and mobile game developers due to its ease of use and flexibility.<br><br>What is Unity Engine?<br><br>Unity engine is a popular and widely used 2D & 3D game engine & development platform. It was developed by Unity Technologies & first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine. Unity is also used for development of augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR) applications that comprise applications, games,etc.<br><br>What makes it well-liked is that it's easy to use and more importantly is its support of the C# programming language natively. Furthermore, its intuitive interface and straightforward objects and components make using it a breeze.<br><br>Recently, Unity announced that as of January 2024, it will start charging per download; in other words, starting January 1st, Unity will charge game developers each time a game using its engine is downloaded.<br><br>Unity’s fee per download will be effective once sales reach a threshold of $200,000 in revenue over 12 months and 200,000 total installs. Additionally, the charge value will depend on the type of license the developer possesses, but it could reach $0.20 per install.<br><br>This shockingly new announcement left game developers confused and outraged; some developers are even calling for totally reversing this new charge policy, and others considered moving their projects to different engines<br><br>According to Bloomberg, Unity may ask its developers to “self-report” the needed data as a means for tracking installations.<br><br>How Popular is Unity Engine Among Developers?<br><br>According to the Unity Gaming report 2022, the number of games made with Unity had grown by 93%, with 5 million monthly Unity app downloads.<br><br>Why is Unity Engine so Popular?<br><br>Ease of Use: Unity is quite a user-friendly engine to use new and seasoned developers alike. Its intuitive interface features a drag and drop system, and a seamless straightforward editor which grants it an edge over other developing engines.<br><br>Multi-Platform Support: Unity is quite extensive in its offerings as it allows developers to create games and applications that can run on an array of platforms that include Windows, macOs, Linux, Android, gaming consoles, among others. Such a cross-platform compatibility makes for a comprehensive engine that is convenient for developers with various expertise and background experiences.<br><br>Asset Management: Unity has a distinct feature which is the inclusion of an asset management system that allows developers to import, organize, and work with an array of assets that include 3D models, textures, audio files, and animations. Such a feature is extremely helpful and convenient for game developers.<br><br>Large Community: Unity has a huge and active community of developers, thus there is a copious amount of tutorials, forums, and many other available online resources.<br><br>State Of The Art Graphics: Unity possesses superb levels of visuals, lighting effects, post processing effects, and accelerated lightmap processing.<br><br>What Triple-A Titles have been Made with Unity?<br><br>There are many triple-a games that have been developed with Unity including: Assassin’s Creed:Unity, Rust, Tom Clancy’s The Division, among many others. In addition to a wide selection of mobile games such as Genshin Impact, Cuphead, Pokemon GO, etc.<br><br>Final Thoughts<br><br>Even though Unity has been a hot topic for journalists and bloggers for the past two weeks, one can’t shirk the fact that it is indeed a convenient platform for developers, especially indie game developers. Its competitive advantage over other engines could be characterized by its versatility and user-friendly nature as stated earlier.<br></p>
